# Minimal dependencies for Google Colab
# Avoid installing/upgrading Jupyter, IPython, ipykernel, tornado, pyzmq, etc.
# PyTorch is preinstalled on Colab; do NOT pin/upgrade it here.

# Core runtime deps used by this project
datasets>=2.14.0
huggingface-hub>=0.20.0
accelerate>=0.26.0

tqdm>=4.66.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Optional: useful but safe
# einops>=0.6.0

# NOTE:
# - Install with: pip install -r colab-requirements.txt --no-deps
#   then, if needed, run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps datasets huggingface-hub accelerate tqdm numpy
# - This prevents pip from upgrading Colab's system packages.
